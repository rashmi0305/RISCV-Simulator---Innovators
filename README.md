    Questions in initial state:
    how to initialize registers and memory
    should we use map to map register name to its value 
    how to access contents in registers and update the values
    questions in intermediate state:
    Should execute have separate file or include inside processor(while pipelining then?)
    Should we consider using enums for register names,instruction types,opcodes or directly access them in string format
    Should the parser parse from a file containing the instructions or otherwise
