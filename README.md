# RISC-V SIMULATOR 
-----
## Team Innovators

## Building and Running the Program

After cloning the GitHub repository containing the C++ code and the Makefile, follow these steps to build and run the program:

1. **Navigate to the Repository Directory**: Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where the repository was cloned.

2. **Build the Program**: Run the `make` command to build the program. This will compile the `processor.cpp` file and generate an executable named `simulator`.

    ```bash
    make
    ```

3. **Run the Program**: Once the compilation is successful, run the executable generated by the previous step.

    ```bash
    ./simulator
    ```

4. **Clean Up**: Optionally, clean up the generated object files and executable by running `make clean`.

    ```bash
    make clean
    ```

## Questions we had in initial stages:
    
### Phase -2
    How to check data dependency
    How to calculate IPC 
    How to find whether stall is present or not
    How to do execution based on latency
    How to initialize registers between IF,ID/RF,EXE,MEM and WB and take values from it
    Is there a need for another class-Instruction
    How to write branch prediction so that it can be extended later on
    
### Phase-1
    How to initialize registers and memory
    Should we use map to map register name to its value 
    How to access contents in registers and update the values-using functions or directlt
    Should execute have separate file or include inside processor(while pipelining then?)
    Should we consider using enums for register names,instruction types,opcodes or directly access them in string format
